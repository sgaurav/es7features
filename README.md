ES7 is the upcoming evolution of the ECMA-262 standard(commonly referred as Javascript). Work on ES7 was started even before ECMAScript 6 was finalized.

This is in very early stage, you can checkout [Understanding ES6](https://github.com/sgaurav/understanding-es6) for easy examples on more mature and stable ES6.

ES7 browser support can be tracked [here](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/esnext/)
